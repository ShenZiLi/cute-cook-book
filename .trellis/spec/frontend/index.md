## Pre-Development Checklist

- For work touching recipe quantities, navigation, timers, or local photos, read [State Management](./state-management.md) before editing.
- Follow the relevant requirement and design artifacts in the active Trellis task.

## Quality Check

- Run `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm run test`.
- Check per-step displayed quantities against the total; inspect actions must not change active progress or countdown state.
- Verify a mobile browser can restore a running or expired timer and can report photo storage errors.

## How to Fill These Guidelines

For each guideline file:

1. Document your project's **actual conventions** (not ideals)
2. Include **code examples** from your codebase
3. List **forbidden patterns** and why
4. Add **common mistakes** your team has made

The goal is to help AI assistants and new team members understand how YOUR project works.

**Language**: All documentation should be written in **English**.
